            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The AMD journey began with dozens of employees focused on leading-edge semiconductor
            products. From those modest beginnings, AMD has grown into a global company setting the standard for modern
            computing through major technological achievements and many important industry firsts along the way.
            Today, AMD is the high performance and adaptive computing leader, powering the products and services
            that define the future of the data center, artificial intelligence, PCs, gaming, communications, and
            automotive.

                <h3>Goal and Progress</h3>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;AMD is also committed to increasing the percentage of global
                    female hires in engineering roles and the percentage of the under-represented group (URG) hires
                    within our U.S. workforce year over year. In 2021, we made these efforts a component of our
                    company’s strategic metrics and milestones to inform our annual incentive plan, which is a
                    compensation element of our Total Rewards Program. We are pleased to share that in 2021 we exceeded
                    the hiring goals we set, leading to a 1 percent increase in the total population of AMD female
                    engineers and a 1.6 percent increase in our URG focus areas overall. In 2022, we will continue these
                    efforts for inclusion as a component of our company’s strategic metrics and milestones.</p>
