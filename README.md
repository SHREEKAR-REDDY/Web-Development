# Web-Development
This is a repository for developing my web development skills.
I will start with basic HTML, then CSS and lastly, to JavaScript which will end my journey in learning the basics of html.

## EXP 1

I've learned some of the basic html element tags. 
For example, `<table>`, `<li>` especially if I have to focus.
I've prepared a resume about myself leveraging the `<table>` tag to indent the text without requiring CSS
## EXP 2

I've stepped up my game little bit.
I've learned about `<form>` elements and `<iframe>` tag for embedding previews or other websites into it.
I've also discovered the `<a>` tag for redirecting to other links or websites.
## EXP 3

I've started learning CSS at this point of time.
I went ahead and brought out my creativity and tried to advertise the AMD corporation.
The website looks a bit clean, not up to the real world level. I feel like this got to be my best works at this point.
