# Web-Development
This is a repository for developing my web development skills.
I will start with basic HTML, then CSS and lastly, to JavaScript which will end my journey in learning the basics of html.

## EXP 1

I've learned some of the basic html element tags. 
For example, `<table>`, `<li>` especially if I have to focus.
I've prepared a resume about myself leveraging the `<table>` tag to indent the text without requiring CSS
## EXP 2

I've stepped up my game little bit.
I've learned about `<form>` elements and `<iframe>` tag for embedding previews or other websites into it.
I've also discovered the `<a>` tag for redirecting to other links or websites.
## EXP 3

I've started learning CSS at this point of time.
I went ahead and brought out my creativity and tried to advertise the AMD corporation.
The website looks a bit clean, not up to the real world level. I feel like this got to be my best works at this point.
## EXP 4

With the Knowledge I've gained from the previous Experiment, I've tried creating my own sign in and sign up page. Though the design can be improved a lot, still tried my best, not a creative designer thinker, by putting all my efforts.
## EXP 5

I've started learning JavaScript now. I've created two websites which are `Cake Shop` and `EMI Calculator`. JavaScript is pretty fun to play with. The syntax is much easier than what I thought it would be.
## EXP 6

In here, I've learnt to understand that I can modify CSS elements with JavaScript. With the combination of CSS and JavaScript I was also able to create an animation where a car moves from Left to Right of the screen.
## EXP 7

I stepped up my game and started exploring more in JQuery. I've implemented the two web pages one calculates the budget out of total budget specified, whereas, other web page is about manipulating CSS with JQuery which I've tested in previous experiments.
## EXP 8

I have gone one more level up and started learning Angular JS. I've implemented the same Budget calculator app in here too. I'm more shocked of how dynamic this language is. The syntax is very straight forward to learn and the structure of the code perfectly makes sense. I love this language at this point. I've created a dynamic Inventory web page which will stores the data (not in any database, only in memory as of now) and updates the table without refreshing the page.
## EXP 9

Using Angular JS I've performed client side validation in a user's registration form. I've also learnt routing between webpage without updating the webpage URL, by keeping it constant.


# Final Thoughts of my Journey

This has been a very good learning in my life. Initially working with only HTML and CSS was very annoying, because I needed to be creative to be able to design a good webpage. However, after discovering JQuery and Angualr JS, the journey started to get fun.

Anyone discovered this repo hope you enjoy which journey of starting web development.
